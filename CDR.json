    "question": "What does 'top up of credit' mean?",
    "answer": "Top up of credit refers to the process of adding more funds or credit to your Prepaid SIM Card so that you can continue using your mobile phone services. Let's say you have a pay as you go sim only deals, and you've used up your existing credit balance. To ensure you can still make calls, send texts, or use data, you would need to top up your credit. This involves making a payment to your mobile network provider, either online, through a top-up voucher, or at a physical store. The amount you top up gets added to your account balance, allowing you to use your phone services again. In essence, 'top up of credit' is a way to keep your mobile phone working by maintaining a positive balance on your prepaid account. It's a convenient way to manage your phone expenses and stay connected without being tied to a monthly contract."
